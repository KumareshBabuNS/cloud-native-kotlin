# cloud-native-kotlin

A Kotlin-flavored version of 'Cloud Native Java'

I wanted to make running all of this as easy as possible, so I'm relying on [the fabulous `spring cloud` CLI](https://spring.io/blog/2016/11/02/introducing-the-spring-cloud-cli-launcher). Once you've installed it, simply run the following: `spring cloud configserver eureka hystrixdashboard zipkin`
